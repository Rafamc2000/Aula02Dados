# Lesson 02: TypeError, Type Check, Type Conversion, try-except and if
# Example in Python:

# Python supports several basic data types, such as:

# Integers (int): Represent whole numbers.
# Floating Point Numbers (float): Represent real numbers.
# Strings (str): Represent sequences of characters.
# Booleans (bool): Represent true (True) or false (False) values.

# 1. Integers (int)
# Methods and operations:
# + (addition)
# - (subtraction)
# * (multiplication)
# // (integer division)
# % (modulus - remainder of division)

# 2. Floating Point Numbers (float)
# Methods and operations:
# + (addition)
# - (subtraction)
# * (multiplication)
# / (division)
# ** (exponentiation)

# 3. Strings (str)
# Methods and operations:
# .upper() (converts to uppercase)
# .lower() (converts to lowercase)
# .strip() (removes whitespace at the beginning and end)
# .split(sep) (splits the string into a list using sep as the delimiter)
# + (string concatenation)

# 4. Booleans (bool)
# Logical operations:
# and (logical AND)
# or (logical OR)
# not (logical NOT)
# == (equality)
# != (inequality)
